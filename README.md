# Twitter-analysis-code-
Program project using different tools in R to perform Text analysis 
The purpose of this shiny app was too scape tweets from a selected source on the web application and perfrom differnt tools presented in the classroom setting related to text analysis. The tools seen in the source code (avaiable to be seen on in bitbucket) are;

- Word clouds (uni, Bi, Tri, tf-idf)
- Emotional analysis of text and extracting a score
- Sentimental Analysis

These functions were all used on a datatable of tweets scapred from celebrirty Chrissy Tiegan. All tweets were cleaned and edited before being put into corpus for use of the above functions. The cleaningand processing code is also avaiable with the Markdown file on bit bucket.

Side notes:

For the comparsion contrast wordcloud; This feuter would not pop up on the app itself, so that tab has been removed from the app but code to view or replicate the work cloud is avaiable in the file. 

As for the Sentimnetal analysis chart; Would not pop up on the app and it too was removed. To view the desired finish product, look at the last cell in the markdown file to see the desired product.
